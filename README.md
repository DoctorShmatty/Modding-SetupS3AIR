____________



In case you are new to the Sonic 3 A.I.R. Modding Community, Here is how to set up mods!

STEP 1: Go to any search engine and search “Sonic 3 A.I.R. Mods” and you should find some websites.
STEP 2: Download the mod you want.

STEP 3: Launch “Sonic 3 A.I.R”s APK and right-click the screen. Then click “Open Mods Folder”. Open another folder app and hold on your mod. Drag it into the mods folder on the second window. And you are done!

Unfortunately, I do not know how to mod it on mobile. Sorry for the inconvenience.

                                         Have Fun with your new mods!
